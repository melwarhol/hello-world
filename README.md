Hiyo--

Mel here (pseudonym: melwarhol, /sunglasses guy emoji/), I'm a jr. developer at Ritchie Brands and I've worked in the Tourism Industry for about 6 and a half years as an Office Administrator. I'd say I'm currently training to be a front-end ninja..but I'm open to learning everything there is to know about front-end and back-end web development. I'm obsessed with shows such as: Portlandia and Orange is the New Black, and one day I'd love to produce my own stop motion film : )...I'm 27 years old btw..not that it's important.

cheers!

mel.
